Samples received at WHOI and analyzed with Lumos using semi-targeted method (set of known m/z values to fragment and then fragment other features if the MS does not find a m/z on the list). See the [KujawinskiLaboratory/UntargCode/](https://github.com/KujawinskiLaboratory/UntargCode) for a full description of all the steps used here and the resulting datafiles.
